entropart is an R package that provides functions to calculate alpha, beta and gamma diversity of communities, 
including phylogenetic and functional diversity.
  
Estimation-bias corrections are available.

## Details

In the entropart package, individuals of different *species* are counted in several *communities* which may (or not) 
be agregated to define a *metacommunity*. 
In the metacommunity, the probability to find a species in the weighted average of probabilities in communities. 
This is a naming convention, which may correspond to plots in a forest inventory or any data organized the same way.

Basic functions allow computing diversity of a community. 
Data is simply a vector of probabilities (summing up to 1) or of abundances (integer values that are numbers of individuals). 
Calculate entropy with functions such as *Tsallis*, *Shannon*, *Simpson*, *Hurlbert* or *GenSimpson* 
and explicit diversity (i.e. effective number of species) with *Diversity* and others. 
By default, the best available estimator of diversity will be used, according to the data.
  
Communities can be simulated by *rCommunity*, explicitely declared as a species distribution (*as.AbdVector* or *as.ProbaVector*), 
and plotted.
  
Phylogenetic entropy and diversity can be calculated if a phylogenetic (or functional), ultrametric tree is provided. 
See *PhyloEntropy*, *Rao* for examples of entropy and *PhyloDiversity* to calculate phylodiversity, 
with the state-of-the-art estimation-bias correction. 
Similarity-based diversity is calculated with *Dqz*, based on a similarity matrix.

# Vignettes

A quick [introduction](https://ericmarcon.github.io/entropart/articles/entropart.html) is in `vignette("entropart")`.

A full documentation is available online, in the "Articles" section of the web site of the vignette.
It is a continuous update of the paper published in the Journal of Statistical Software ([Marcon & HÃ©rault, 2015](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v067.i08)).

The [development version documentation](https://EricMarcon.github.io/entropart/dev/) is also available.
